Do you know how to drive? If yes, I ensure face this problem before such as you come across a terrible traffic jam on the other side of the highway. Long lines of cars barely moving. As you keep driving, police car start appearing from afar shutting down the highway. It is an accident and there's a helicopter transporting the ones involved in the crash to the nearest hospital.They must be in critical condition for all this to be happening.\n\nSo I am going to predict the severity of an accident based on weather, road conditons and light conditions. It can warn you before by given the weather and the road conditions about the possibility of you getting into a car accident and how severe it would be, so that you would drive more carefully or even change your travel if you are able to."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data Section"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "I will use the data that provided by the course to predict the severity of an accident based on weather, road conditons and light conditions.
